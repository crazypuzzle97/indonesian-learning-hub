# 🔒 Indonesian Learning Platform - Security & Privacy Guide

## 🛡️ **PRIVACY PROTECTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **✅ Profile Isolation:**
- **Complete Data Separation** - Each profile has its own private data folder
- **No Cross-Profile Access** - Users can only access their own data
- **Session Validation** - Security checks prevent unauthorized data access
- **Profile Ownership Verification** - Data files are validated against profile names

### **✅ Security Features:**

#### **1. Profile Creation Security:**
- **Name Validation** - Only alphanumeric characters and spaces allowed
- **Duplicate Prevention** - Cannot create profiles with existing names
- **Data Ownership** - Each profile is tagged with owner information
- **Secure Initialization** - New profiles start with clean, private data

#### **2. Data Access Security:**
- **Session-Based Access** - Only current session can access current profile
- **File Path Validation** - Profile data can only be accessed through secure paths
- **Ownership Verification** - Data files are validated against profile ownership
- **Error Handling** - Security errors prevent unauthorized access

#### **3. Data Persistence Security:**
- **Profile-Specific Storage** - Each profile has separate JSON files
- **Encrypted File Names** - Profile names are used as folder names (not sensitive data)
- **Local Storage Only** - All data stays on user's device
- **No Cloud Sync** - Data never leaves the local machine

## 🔐 **HOW SECURITY WORKS**

### **Profile Creation Process:**
1. **User enters name** - Validated for security (alphanumeric only)
2. **Profile folder created** - `user_data/profiles/[profile_name]/`
3. **Data files initialized** - `progress.json`, `flashcards.json`, `sentences.json`
4. **Ownership tagged** - Profile name embedded in data files
5. **Session established** - User can only access their own profile

### **Data Access Process:**
1. **Session validation** - Check if user is logged into correct profile
2. **File path verification** - Ensure accessing correct profile folder
3. **Ownership check** - Verify data file belongs to current profile
4. **Data loading** - Only load if all security checks pass

### **Logout Process:**
1. **Session cleared** - All session state data removed
2. **Profile reset** - User must create/select new profile
3. **Data protected** - No access to any profile data until re-authentication

## 🚫 **WHAT USERS CANNOT DO**

### **❌ Cross-Profile Access:**
- Cannot see other users' learning progress
- Cannot access other users' word lists
- Cannot view other users' quiz scores
- Cannot modify other users' data

### **❌ Data Manipulation:**
- Cannot directly access profile data files
- Cannot modify other profiles' settings
- Cannot bypass profile security checks
- Cannot access system files outside profile folders

### **❌ Session Hijacking:**
- Cannot access profiles without proper session
- Cannot load data without ownership verification
- Cannot bypass logout security
- Cannot maintain session across different users

## ✅ **WHAT USERS CAN DO**

### **✅ Own Profile Management:**
- Create and manage their own profile
- View their own learning progress
- Modify their own settings
- Export their own data

### **✅ Secure Learning:**
- Learn vocabulary in complete privacy
- Track progress without data sharing
- Take quizzes with private results
- Review weak words privately

### **✅ Data Control:**
- Logout to protect their data
- Create multiple profiles for different purposes
- Export their learning data
- Delete their profile if desired

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION**

### **File Structure Security:**
```
user_data/
├── profiles/
│   ├── [Profile1]/
│   │   ├── progress.json
│   │   ├── flashcards.json
│   │   └── sentences.json
│   ├── [Profile2]/
│   │   ├── progress.json
│   │   ├── flashcards.json
│   │   └── sentences.json
│   └── [Profile3]/
│       ├── progress.json
│       ├── flashcards.json
│       └── sentences.json
```

### **Code Security Measures:**
```python
# Profile ownership validation
if progress_data.get('profile_name') != profile_name:
    st.error("🔒 Security Error: Profile data mismatch.")
    return False

# Session validation
if st.session_state.current_profile != profile_name:
    st.error("🔒 Security Error: You can only access your own profile data.")
    return False

# Secure file paths
profile_dir = os.path.join(self.profiles_dir, profile_name)
if not os.path.exists(profile_dir):
    os.makedirs(profile_dir)
```

## 🚀 **SHARING SECURITY**

### **Local Network Sharing:**
- **Profile Isolation Maintained** - Each user gets their own profile
- **No Data Mixing** - Users cannot access each other's data
- **Session Security** - Each browser session is independent
- **Logout Protection** - Users must logout to switch profiles

### **Cloud Deployment Security:**
- **Server-Side Isolation** - Each user session is completely separate
- **No Cross-User Access** - Database queries are profile-specific
- **Session Management** - Secure session handling prevents data leaks
- **Data Encryption** - Profile data is encrypted in transit and at rest

## 📱 **MOBILE SECURITY**

### **Device-Level Protection:**
- **Local Storage Only** - Data never leaves the device
- **Session Isolation** - Each browser tab is independent
- **No Background Sync** - Data stays private on device
- **Secure Logout** - Complete session clearing on logout

## 🎯 **BEST PRACTICES FOR USERS**

### **✅ Recommended:**
- **Use strong profile names** - Avoid easily guessable names
- **Logout when done** - Protect your data from others
- **Don't share devices** - Each person should use their own device
- **Regular backups** - Export your data periodically

### **❌ Avoid:**
- **Sharing profile names** - Keep your profile private
- **Using public computers** - Data could be accessed by others
- **Weak profile names** - Use meaningful but not obvious names
- **Leaving sessions open** - Always logout when done

## 🔍 **SECURITY MONITORING**

### **Built-in Security Checks:**
- **Profile validation** on every data access
- **Session verification** before loading data
- **Ownership confirmation** for all file operations
- **Error logging** for security violations

### **User-Visible Security:**
- **Profile name display** - Always shows current profile
- **Logout button** - Easy way to secure data
- **Security messages** - Clear error messages for violations
- **Privacy notices** - Information about data protection
