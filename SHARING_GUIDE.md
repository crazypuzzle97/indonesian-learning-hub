# 🇮🇩 Indonesian Learning Platform - Sharing Guide

## 🚀 How to Share This Platform

### **Option 1: Local Network Sharing (Easiest)**

1. **Find your computer's IP address:**
   ```bash
   # On Mac/Linux:
   ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
   
   # On Windows:
   ipconfig
   ```

2. **Run the app with network access:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py --server.address 0.0.0.0 --server.port 8501
   ```

3. **Share the network URL:**
   - Your app will be available at: `http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:8501`
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.100:8501`
   - Anyone on the same WiFi can access it!

### **Option 2: Cloud Deployment (Recommended for wider sharing)**
